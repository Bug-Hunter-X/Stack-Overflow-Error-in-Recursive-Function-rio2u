This repository contains a Hack program demonstrating a common error in recursive functions: the lack of a base case for negative input. The bug.hack file showcases the erroneous code, which leads to a stack overflow error when called with a negative argument. The bugSolution.hack file provides the corrected version with a proper check to handle negative values, preventing the stack overflow.  The program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  This is a simple example highlighting the importance of robust base cases in recursive functions.
